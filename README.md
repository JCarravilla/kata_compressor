# Kata: Going functional in Python

### Description
Kata in python suggested by my friend [Edorka](https://github.com/Edorka).

I've to code a **functional program in python** that compress a string by replacing each line
of repeated characters by the current char and the number of times it appear, this way: asssdff
would become as3df2.

### Kata rules
1. I can't use array functions
1. I can't use variables
1. Each function must begin with a return statement
1. I must apply TDD

### To run
$ nose2 --with-coverage
